DECK OF CARDS

I've written 2 tests.  One to verify the amount of cards in the deck, which should assert_equal 52.  And the other to verify that there are a total of 4 suits and 13 cards per suit.  From there I went about making the classes.

Much consternation encountered when trying to run tests effectively.
